## 📄 Project Description
The **Simple To-Do** project is a smart contract-based to-do list app built in Motoko, designed for the Internet Computer. It allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks in a decentralized way. This project showcases how smart contracts can handle task management on the blockchain.

## 🚀 Bootcamp Takeaway
During the **ICP Educate Series Bootcamp** by RiseIn, I gained hands-on experience with **Motoko**, the programming language for smart contracts on the Internet Computer (ICP). It helped me understand how to create efficient decentralized applications like this to-do list project.
